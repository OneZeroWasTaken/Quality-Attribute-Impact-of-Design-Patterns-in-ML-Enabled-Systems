# Interview Script

1.	We will start by giving you some general information.
    1.	This interview is for our master thesis “Quality Attribute Impact of Design Patterns in ML-Enabled Systems” that we are doing on the Software Engineering master program.
    2.	Our goal with the thesis is to find architectural design patterns in component models and evaluate how these impact the overall system in terms of quality attributes.
    3.	We have done a literature review to find patterns, which we now want to evaluate in terms of their impact on quality attributes, which is where you come in.
    4.	The goal for this interview is to get your expert thoughts and ideas on how certain patterns impact quality attributes of ML-systems. We would first and foremost want to know the impact it has on the system as a whole, but how it affects parts of the system, for example the ML model, is also valuable.
    5.	The interview is planned to take 30 minutes. Do you want us to stop after half an hour or can we finish up the last few questions after that point?
    6.	We encourage you to speak your mind, there are no right and wrong answers.
    7.	Everything you say will be anonymous. But if you let us, we would like to leave a thank you in the Acknowledgements part of the thesis by having your name there. Is this okay with you?
    8.	Is it okay if we record this interview?
        1.	Do you have any questions before we start?
2.	Could you very briefly share your experience with machine learning and machine learning systems?
    1.	Do you research anything in areas related to ML?
    2.	Have you worked with ML in or in collaboration with industry?
3.	[Show quality model]
    1.	Do you want us to go through the quality attributes quickly or are you familiar with them?
    2.	Do you have any questions about the quality model?
4.	[Show pattern read aloud definition, explain example]
    1.	Do you understand the pattern?
    2.	Have you used or seen this pattern before?
        1.	[If yes:] When? Where? How?
    3.	Which quality attributes do you think this pattern affects and how?
        1.	We are not fussed about the minor details, and are looking for direct impacts as a consequence of the pattern so impact depending on specific implementation details is not really relevant.
        2.	You don’t have to go through all quality attributes, just share your thoughts on those that stick out the most to you. 
    4.	On a scale of -3 to 3, how much does the pattern affect the mentioned QA of the system and why?
        1.	Consider that some QA can be both positively and negatively impacted from a pattern.
        2.	In these cases, you can give multiple answers for different reasons or contexts. Don’t take an average of them.
    5.	Anything else? [Go back]
    6.	[If no attribute affects system negatively has been mentioned, specifically ask:] Any QAs that are affected negatively?
5.	[Go back to 4 until time is up]
6.	That was everything for this interview. Thank you so much for participating!
    1.	Would you like us to send you the thesis after it is finished?
