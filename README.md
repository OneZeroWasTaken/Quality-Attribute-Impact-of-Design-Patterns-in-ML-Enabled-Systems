### Abstract
As machine learning is becoming a more common part of software systems, the
need for new and improved architectural strategies due to the unique architectural
challenges these systems introduce is becoming apparent. Right now, there is a lack
of knowledge on how to build good architecture for such systems due to their nature
of being rigid, vast, and dependent on data. This study analyses architectural design
patterns in machine learning-enabled systems, and how they impact the quality of
the system as a whole, to enable practitioners to make better architectural design
decisions. The study was conducted by doing a multivocal literature review to
extract component models from which architectural design patterns were derived.
The connection to, and impact of, these patterns on the quality attributes of the
system were then evaluated by interviewing experts. The result of this study is a set
of 14 patterns, and the evaluated impact they have on the quality attributes of the
system. These findings allow practitioners to choose design patterns based on the
sought qualities for their system, making their architectural design decisions better.

This repo is divided into two main parts: ``Multivocal Literature Review`` contains everything related to the MLR including its resulting component models while ``Interviews`` contains the artefacts related to the performed interviews.
